# Asynchronous-decoding

All codes and raw data. 

AP decoder = Average Position decoder;

BG decoder = Block Graph decoder;

CG decoder = Contracted Graph decoder;


The folder "blossom5" contains Edmond's perfect matching algorithm. It must be included in the same folder containing a simulation code in order to be used by the decoder.

Raw data and reading files are in "Data and reading files". The raw data files (except for PE_terms files) contain three columns of numbers: the first is "lattice_size", the second is "physical_error", and the third is "success_probability". The characters '#' and '!' are markers used to read the file.
